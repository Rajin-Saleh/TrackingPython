# List are container to store a set of value of any data type


friends = ["Apple", "orange", 5, 345.06, False, "Akash", "Rohan"]

# print(friends[0])


friends[0] = "Grapes"  # Unlike strings lists are mutable

print(friends[0])

print(friends[1:4])  # list slicing


# list can be index just like string.
